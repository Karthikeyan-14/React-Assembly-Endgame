# Assembly Endgame (React Project)

## 📖 Overview
**Assembly Endgame** is an interactive word-guessing game built with React.  
The game challenges users to guess the correct word, letter by letter, until they either win or lose.  

The word data is imported from a `words.js` file, where all the words are stored inside an array. This makes it easy to expand or customize the game’s word pool.
